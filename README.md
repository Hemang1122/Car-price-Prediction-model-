Car Price Prediction Model
This project is a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features. It uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression techniques to build a reliable and accurate model. This project demonstrates the application of linear regression and data analysis techniques for a real-world scenario, helping users understand how certain factors affect car prices.

Project Overview
Car prices are influenced by multiple factors, such as brand, year of manufacture, mileage, and fuel type. This Car Price Prediction Model takes these features and provides an estimated price for a given set of inputs. The project aims to simplify car price evaluation by giving users a fast and data-driven way to estimate a car's market value.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and normalizes numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Creates relevant features for the model.
Machine Learning Model: Uses a linear regression model to make price predictions.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
User Interface (Optional): Deployed using Streamlit to provide a simple, interactive interface for users to input car details and receive a price prediction.
Technologies Used
Python
NumPy & Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-Learn for model building and evaluation
Streamlit for deployment (optional)
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing includes the following features:

Car Brand
Year of Manufacture
Engine Size
Mileage
Fuel Type
Transmission Type
Note: The dataset should ideally contain a large number of entries to ensure model accuracy.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd car-price-prediction
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Train the Model: Use train_model.py to preprocess the dataset and train the model.

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Make Predictions: Use predict.py to predict the price of a car by providing the necessary features.

bash
Copy code
python predict.py
Launch the App (Optional): Run the Streamlit app for an interactive prediction interface.

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
These metrics give an indication of how well the model performs on unseen data.

Results
The results will vary depending on the data used for training. However, with good data preprocessing and feature selection, the model achieves competitive accuracy in predicting car prices.

Future Improvements
Experiment with other regression models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) for potentially higher accuracy.
Enhance feature selection by analyzing correlations between features.
Add more features that may impact car prices, like location and car condition.
Improve the user interface for a smoother experience.
